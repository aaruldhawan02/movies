As a comic book fan, this was one of the most disappointing shows to watch. Secret Invasion is supposed to be one of the biggest world ending comic book events. Multiple "high ranking" Avengers are replaced by Skrulls. In this show, its just Rhodey. This had absolutely no bearing or effect on the MCU. Incredibly disappointing. They truly should've saved this for an Avengers movie instead of some side cash in a Disney+ show.
