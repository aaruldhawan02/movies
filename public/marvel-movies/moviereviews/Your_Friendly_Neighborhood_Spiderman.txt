The art style in this show is one of the coolest I have ever seen. Although it's not considered to be canon to the "sacred timeline," it was cool to see a possible origin story for Tom Holland's spiderman. The best part of the show was definitely watching Tombstone slowly transition into being the leader of the 110th gang. You can see him go from a reluctant "favorite child" persona to this powered up anti-hero. The "chicken or the egg" twist at the end was incredibly creative, and makes me excited for what the next seasons have in store.
