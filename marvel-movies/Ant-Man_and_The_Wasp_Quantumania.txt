Johnathan Major's Kang is one of the scariest villains in the entire MCU. His portroyal of the character truly makes you contemplate how dangerous the multiverse can be with an infinite number of Kangs. The movie however fell through with subpar cgi in a lot of the scenes. On many occasions it felt like I was watching a modern-day rendition of Spykids 3 meets Sharkboy and Lavagirl. The story is pretty good and does an excellent job of setting up the council of Kangs but unfortunately we'll never get to see the Avengers in a battle against the infinitude of Kangs.
