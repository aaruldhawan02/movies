This was definitely one of the most creative projects that the MCU has had. The fact that they used soap operas from every decade and tailored the theme song to the decade was insanely well done. Every episode ended on like an insane cliffhanger. When this show came out, I was in immense anticipation for the next episode to come out. Whenever I'm rewatching this show though, it's one of the hardest to rewatch because of how it slow it moves after you know the plot. One of the best "one time watch only" projects in the MCU.
