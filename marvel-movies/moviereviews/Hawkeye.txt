Previously in the MCU, Hawkeye was one of the most useless characters I have ever seen in my life. However, this show definitely redeemed him. It showed Hawkeye and his ability to navigate street-level threats. Kate Bishop was also like a really nice breath of fresh air with the MCU. I don't think that she should've been able to take on Kingpin that easily but other that I don't have any complaints with this show. Black Widow introduced Yelena, so it was also great to see her story continue through the MCU.
