After a series of movies that fell short of expectations, Thunderbolts* (The New Avengers) revived the Marvel Hype! This movie connected a group of projects that were previously widely disconnected setting up the next Phase of the MCU. It was extremely well-written with emotion, humor and action. Julia Louis-Dreyfus's portyal of Val brought this like "being on the edge of my seat" vibe during the movie. It was just engaging mission after mission after mission. I can properly say that there was no point in the movie where I was bored or let down.
