Multiverse of Madness is the first movie that connects back to the Disney+ show, and frankly it didn't do it that well. The writers of MoM publicly admitted to not having watched WandaVision prior to writing the movie. That being said....not that bad. Although Scarlet Witch's redemption arc was kinda lost during the movie, I really enjoyed her brutality. Her fight against the Illuminati was phenomenal especially under Sam Raimi's cinematography. John Krasinski's Reed Richards "Fan Cast Cameo" was unexpected but really great to see, although he definitely was not the "smartest man alive." Scarlet Witch was one of the coolest MCU villains, and I do hope that she returns to the big screen.
